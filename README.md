# Silver-Bullet -> the art of espresso

I'm told the silver bullet is a coffee variant engineered with ~4 shots of expresso, butter and coconut oil. It also kills wearwolves. I'll understand if it's not your thing.

It's also an awesome boilerplate for meteor. Let's make it even better!

## Installation:

If you haven't already:

 curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh

git clone https://github.com/wiber/silver-bullet && cd silver-bullet && meteor npm install && meteor
