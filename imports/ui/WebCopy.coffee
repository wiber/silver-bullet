dynamic sections navigatable by these awesome input tools. to grid? from grid? to recent bookmarks? the end result is keyboard navigatable connectable networks..
only one list at a time? incomming, or outgoing,
can the dropdown be the list? not really unless we hide your history, or revert to sectiona;//รง
so then agency instead of in your face.. to show things. the bg will be a network?
what do I want to know about this place? what is default?
it's buzz. connections.
