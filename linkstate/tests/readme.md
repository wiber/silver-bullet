# Design - Implement - Maintain

Imagine an activity where your everyday searching and researching habit created a beautiful tapestry of connections. Projects, resources and people supporting each other in meaningful lasting ways.

Like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad... Because there's something missing in the web. We all know it. We all feel it. The promise is there but instead we get so many great but fragmenting forces.


Linkstates starts as an ultra simple cure for bookmarking. Where it ends is largely up to you.

- [ ] Will it accelerate your research?
- [ ] Will it be on your side when you master you data?
- [ ] Will it put you in a flow state when you use it? Will you feel mastery as you move on by?
- [ ] Will it make planning activites for a trip that much easier?

# Belief, the why

- [ ] your bookmarks should be right there on your newtab
- [ ] bookmarks should be relevant to the last page you were on
- [ ] bookmarks should be weighted so the important ones are at the top
- [ ]

## Rationale and fly-through

The app needs to be ever present to remind you. Trigger serendipity by juxtaposing past finds with your last tab.

Linkstates shows you what a thing is by to what and by who it's connected. More than discovery it's a truth engine for humans. It extends your ability to organize information you're working on. It seeks to expand your expertise and make it visible. Take a stand and also weigh in on this thing.

[ ] It needs to know the last tab you were on when you ctrl+t newtab
[ ] It needs to know the last thing you connected to and default it if not pointing anywhere
[ ] It needs to be able to jump to a connection between two points if exists, with title there already in dropdowns

[ ] It needs to visually show how last tab is connected

[ ] It needs to host a authoritative discussion about it's relevance to truth and other sources
[ ] It needs to allow fast, keyboard only staching of interesting things

[ ] It needs to extend your mind by reminding you of the path behind you (like Morpheus)

[ ] It needs to define itself on the front page and thus market itself

The front page shows incoming links from a number of articles, wiki pages, and other services. Faces, sizes and positions jolts you..

--- show talk only on this from / to. facebook comments? two kinds of comments? no. justify your position. array of changes visible. fb talk about the what that article says about this place.
[ ] It shows weighted comments on this from - to space.
.. but only these. click the from to to see the talk, otherwise only see globes and faces.

What does this say about that?

The method can return.. the meta data of from and to.. Titles etc. Should we call the method even when not logged in to

It is open for free users and has a freemium privacy feature.

Let's think through the priorities for a system such as this.
It needs to be a visual language and as such self explanatory on the first page.
It needs to be fast and responsive since it runs on the newtab.
It needs to do seo and therefore ssr enabled. Helps with fast?

how can we handle

It inserts new dynamics to how we move information around. The apps i useful for one, game changing when a group applies it to a purpose.
