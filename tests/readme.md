# Design - Implement - Maintain

Linkstates is an ultra simple cure for bookmarking.

With Linkstates you:

* link resources to your web things.
* see those links on your newtab when you leave a related page.
* kiss bookmarking folders goodbye!
* collaborate by suggesting resources to friends and collegues pages
* express your expertise by weighing in on a link

The result? An activity that makes sense from your 35 open tabs.

To get started get the extension for your [chrome](https://www.meteor.com/try) browser.

Next, log in with Facebook and start sharing resources. Premium accounts are in the works where you log in with linkedin. Premium users can keep their work private and share within organizations.
